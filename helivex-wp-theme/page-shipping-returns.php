                <p class="text-xs text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed">
                    Helivex Labs ships exclusively within the <strong>United States</strong>. We do not offer international shipping to maintain strict regulatory compliance with export laws. 
                    All orders are processed within 24-48 business hours and shipped via tracked carrier.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold uppercase tracking-tight">1. Delivery Times</h3>
            <p>
                Standard laboratory fulfillment typically arrives within 3-5 business days. You will receive a tracking number via email once your research compounds have been dispatched.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold uppercase tracking-tight">2. No Refund & Return Policy</h3>
            <p>
                Due to the sensitive nature of <strong>Research Use Only (RUO)</strong> lyophilized compounds and the necessity of maintaining a strictly controlled cold chain and sterile environment, <strong>Helivex Labs does not accept returns or offer refunds.</strong>
                <br><br>
                Once a research compound leaves our facility, its integrity can no longer be guaranteed to the level required for laboratory standards. To ensure the safety and precision of all research conducted with our materials, we do not restock or resell any returned items.
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Final Sale:</strong> All purchases are final. No exceptions will be made for "unopened" or "unused" materials.</li>
                    <li><strong>Laboratory Integrity:</strong> This policy is in place to protect the scientific community and ensure that every researcher receives materials that have never been out of our controlled custody.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold uppercase tracking-tight">3. Damaged or Incorrect Orders</h3>
            <p>
                If your order arrives damaged (e.g., broken glass vials), please provide photographic evidence within 24 hours of delivery. We will issue a replacement shipment immediately upon verification.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold uppercase tracking-tight">4. Chargebacks & Disputes</h3>
            <p>
                We encourage all researchers to contact <strong>support@helivexlabs.com</strong> before initiating a bank dispute. Fraudulent chargebacks are taken seriously and will result in a permanent ban from our supply network and reporting to high-risk merchant databases.
